<h4>After 8+ years of working as a Cloud Architect, I have fallen in love with the following areas of cloud computing</h4>

- DevOps - honestly at this point all the Ops i.e DevSecOps, MLOps... you name it and I've probably dealt with it
- Tools/Frameworks that make building and deploying containers easier
- Kubernetes - GitOps, Security, and really anything that helps make it easier for people to use Kubernetes 
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC): CDK, Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation
- Serverless - Event Driven Architectures (yes, I understand there is a difference), Messaging, Data Processing
- Cost optimization approaches to help reduce your cloud bill
- Typescript, Python, Golang are my favorite languages at the moment
- Trying to learn how to love Rust... 

<h4>Other areas that I'm passionate about</h4>

- Helping folks of all experience levels and backgrounds achieve careers in the tech industry (bonus points if you're coming from a non-technical background)
- Career Mentorship 
- Technical enablement on the areas mentioned above
- Sales enablement because sometimes our friends need help selling this stuff
- Building Go-To-Market (GTM) strategies that produce meaningful results and insights
